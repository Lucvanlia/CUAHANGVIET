Many who become addicted to drugs start out as social users, using drugs to relax or wind down at parties or work functions. For those most susceptible to dependence and addiction, social drug use gradually turns into using after work or using first thing in the morning. Drug and alcohol detox can be the toughest step in any journey through substance use recovery. Learn more about symptoms, treatment, and aftercare.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, I was so ruled by terror I couldn\u2019t even admit I was scared. Sobriety has changed most of that. If you\u2019re \u201csober curious\u201d \u2026If you are drinking too much too often and want to stop or take a break\u2026or if you have stopped drinking and are trying to stick to sober! Many destructive labels occur when we are children with no skills to overcome.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"toc-1\">Understanding Nifaliophobia: The Fear of Being Sober<\/h2>\n<p>Then I wouldn\u2019t have to think about how horrible the life I was living was. I needed to find some way of dealing with it, of turning that fear into power, of letting it drive me to something positive.<\/p>\n<p>For most of those seeking recovery, this will be one of the most real fears they have when they get sober because the pain inside can be very scary. However, with professional help, this can also be  done much easier than most people think. A life in recovery gives you the unique opportunity to develop healthy coping mechanisms. These mechanisms will pave the way for overcoming hardship without relying on a substance. These healthy coping mechanisms are more sustainable than numbing pain or trying to drink away your past challenges. When people drink or use drugs, it frequently starts as a way to deal with hardships but becomes a primary coping mechanism.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"toc-2\">Staying Sober Through the PAWS<\/h2>\n<p>Because they think they&#8217;ll hate it, many people don&#8217;t want to get clean. As someone who drinks or takes drugs, it&#8217;s not hard to see why the idea of living <a href=\"https:\/\/ecosoberhouse.com\/\">https:\/\/ecosoberhouse.com\/<\/a> a sober life is difficult. When you get sober, many people don&#8217;t know that there are many ways that your life will be a million times better.<\/p>\n<p>This does not mean it will always work for you, but it might. Developing relationships and talking through the waves of anxiety are healthy steps that you can use throughout your recovery. Family and friends are the easiest people to hurt when you are struggling with addiction.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"toc-3\">Treatment Facilities<\/h2>\n<p>A lot of the statements made sense and are very true. Nobody knows what the future holds. Worrying about it constantly will only strengthen your fears, and lessen your resolve to do anything. It\u2019s a convenient cop out we\u2019re all guilty of using. I failed more times than I can count before I finally got it right and I assure you there is nothing special about me that you can\u2019t find within yourself. You don\u2019t have to produce some hidden, superhuman strength to be successful at sobriety.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class='aligncenter' style='margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto' src=\"https:\/\/ecosoberhouse.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/what-to-do-if-the-person-you-love-is-an-addict-1.jpg\" width=\"309px\" alt=\"Fear of Being Sober\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In fact, for many of us returning to use is a reality of recovery. By its very nature, substance use disorder is referred to as a relapsing condition. It took five years for it  to stick with me. I would much rather fail and keep trying than stay stuck on a one-way path to destruction. And worrying about what others may think if you return to use is outside of your control. You focus on you and the people who are supposed to be in your life will support you along the way. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s change that you\u2019re so afraid of.<\/p>\n<p>They will leave to keep taking drugs or alcohol . Without the influence of substances, you have the opportunity to enjoy sober relationships while ending toxic relationships. You can form authentic relationships built on mutual respect, interests, and understanding rather than just who is willing or available to drink or use drugs with you. Life after addiction might also mean you have more professional success and new creative outlets that you discover when drugs and alcohol aren\u2019t occupying all of your time. Living in sobriety is anything but boring. Whether you\u2019re newly sober or sober curious, here are just some of the reasons to love being sober.<\/p>\n<p>Most fears that we faced were about our relationships and how they\u2019d change, how we\u2019d cope, fear of failure, and the fear of change itself. We\u2019d like to cover some common fears of attaining sobriety, as well as the best ways to overcome them. If your friends don\u2019t want to hang out with you unless you\u2019re drinking, then you know where you stand with each other.<\/p>\n<p>Social anxiety is a huge fear that we all deal with post-rehab. Going to the grocery store, a task that seemed so simple beforehand, can feel like an insurmountable feat. It feels like everyone is looking at you and, somehow, they instinctively know your little secret. Everybody seems to know you\u2019re a recovering addict who\u2019s struggling to get through the day without relapsing\u2026and they\u2019re all looking at you. Once out of rehab, it quickly becomes apparent that life didn\u2019t stop while we were in treatment. For months, we\u2019ve focused on overcoming an addiction and, outside of that single goal, nothing else has mattered. Obviously, that can make post-rehab life a little jarring.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Content More in Signs of Addiction Understanding Nifaliophobia: The Fear of Being Sober Staying Sober Through the PAWS Treatment Facilities responses to \u201cThawing Out the Fear of Going Sober\u201d If you didn\u2019t want to change, you wouldn\u2019t bother to get sober.
